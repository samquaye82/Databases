# Databases
For this project, I was required to create a program for a bookstore. The program should allow the clerk to enter data about new books into the database, update book information, delete books from the database and search to find the availability of books in the database.

I follow these steps:
  - Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. The program allows the clerk to:
      - add new books to the database
      - update book information
      - delete books from the database
      - search the database to find a specific book.

I create a database called ebookstore and a table called books. The table has the following structure:

* id Title Author Qty

The program presents the user with the following menu:
    1. Enter book
    2. Update book
    3. Delete book
    4. Search books
    0. Exit

And the executes each user prompted selection with the relevant functionality.
